This is an unofficial, unsupported semi-fork of the MySQLdb driver by Andy
Dustman as hosted on SourceForge:

It includes a number of my own patches and aggressive clean-ups, tracked in git
since tracking my work in an anonymous svn repo with myriad patches not yet
committed upstream became a burden.

This code should be considered dangerous, unstable, toxic to small children and
household pets.  It is merely a side project of mine to see if I can stabilize
the 1.2 branch, drag it forward, and fix a number of bugs people are
encountering.
